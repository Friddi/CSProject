This log is a notebook for the final project of the course. Here I write
almost everything I do and most of my ideas for the project as well.

The first step is to get somewhat aquainted with the structure of the overlaps.m4
 file.
	* To do this I use simple unix commands like less to
	  navigate the file in a way that does not use to much
	  computer power. Opening the file in a text editor is
	  practically not feasible because of the files size.
	* It might be practical to know how many edges are in 
	  the file so we use the bash command 
	
		wc -l
	 
	  to count the lines in the file and saving them to
	  log. We see that there are
  
		64056772

	  lines in the file.
